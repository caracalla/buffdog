This is the historical archive of my first stab at `buffdog`, entirely in C.
* `ray_tracer` - A rudimentary real-time ray tracer.
* `buffdog` - The real-time rasterizer now known as `rockshot`, at a much earlier stage of development.  I restarted and ported everything to C++ after hitting enough unpleasantries dealing with bare C.
