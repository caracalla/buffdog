# Buffdog

## TODO
* tie velocity/movement to FPS
* make the triangle drawing code less hideous
* basic physics (collisions, gravity)

## Setup
1. Install SDL2
1. `make run`

## Targets
* `buffdog` - Whatever I'm working on.  Currently, a real time rasterizer.

### Legacy Targets
* `spinner` - A simple spinning line, used to test that everything works.
* `ray_tracer` - A rudimentary real time ray tracer.
* `buffdog` - the rasterizer in the root directory, at a much earlier stage of development.
